About me
======
I'm a third-year PhD student from the Laboratory for System Dependability at the University of Tsukuba, Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Fumio Machida](https://www.sd.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/index.html). My research focuses on software reliability, especially reliability and dependability of machine learning systems in safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and critical infrastructure systems.


Research Interests
======
• Reliability of Machine Learning Systems

• Stochastic Models for Dependability Analysis

• Software Reliability Evaluation and Design
